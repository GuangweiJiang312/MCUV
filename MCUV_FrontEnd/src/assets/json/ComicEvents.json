It possessed no land-line phones, and no cellular links or satellite dishes.  A cybernetic organism which came to be known as Reverend Paul (adopting the identity of a young boy who'd died under government experiments) eventually kiled all the non-mutant population, and began forcing the mutant population to live peacefully as he wished them, under his nannite control.  William Stryker, Lady Deathstrike, and the X-Men eventually found the town; Reverend Paul's withdrew his nannites from Mt. Haven's population, killing those who'd been there for a long period of time.  Shadowcat buried Reverend Stryker and Reverend Paul together, confining them underground together to work out their differences.  The survivors were evacuated, and Bishop detonated the town's thermal plant, destroying the town, after which the government claimed a volcanic eruption had buried \"an uninhabited valley.\"",

Deadpool killed Malachi, leading Strange to appear to claim her powers and the Moebius Stone.  However, Dr. Druid used the stone's energies to destroy itself, restoring Seattle and leaving its citizens' memories of the events as little more than a confusing daydream.  The Secret Defenders apparently departed soon thereafter, taking Cadaver with them.",
