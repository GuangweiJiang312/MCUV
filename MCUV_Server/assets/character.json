In Afghanistan, Tony was attacked and captured by a terrorist group and the attack left shrapnel fragments dangerously lodged in his chest. In order to escape, he created a suit of armour powered by an arc reactor (which also prevents the shrapnel from reaching his heart.) When he returned home, he further improved the armour and became Iron Man. The armour grants him extraordinary strength, flight capability and a whole arsenal of advanced weapons."

After getting into a severe car accident, Stephen damaged the nerve endings of his fingers which resulted in his hands being practically crippled. After his futile search for a cure in Western medicine, Stephen turned to the Mystic Arts for healing. Told to go to a place called Kamar-Taj in Nepal, he journeyed to the Far East and found the Ancient One. Stephen trained under the Ancient One and Karl Mordo to slowly regain the use of his hands, while also helping his masters fend off an imminent threat of Kaecilius, a former student of the Ancient One who went rogue and tried to merge Earth with the Dark Dimension. After witnessing the death of the Ancient One, Stephen became the new protector of the New York Sanctum, facing off Kaecilius and Dormammu, the ruler of the Dark Dimension with the help of the Eye of Agamotto, which contained the Time Stone. Stephen later helped Thor locate Odin after Loki banished their father to Earth."
